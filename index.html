    <h1>Final Project Proposal</h1>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Project Name: Kaleidoscope Draw</li>
        <li>Team Members: Myself (Amelia)</li>
        <li>Overview: My final project will be hosted through github, but run as a python application.</li>
        <li>Overview: I will be using python and turtle draw.</li>
        <li>Last Updated: 12/08/23</li>
        <li>I am thinking of creating a Monkey draw, similar to turtle draw but with a monkey.
          I did not end up creating a monkey, instead I drew a kaleidoscope.</li>
        <li> I would like to have the application close after it is finished, and the user
          hits any key.</li>
        <li>Basic features include loops, functions, and importing libraries.</li>
        <li> Advanced features include color changing like a rainbow and different shapes.</li>
      </ol>
